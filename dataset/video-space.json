If you create a smart contract and call it, my paintings, then each count, coin or hash would be referred to a different owner, then when ownership changes, this would be passed as a transaction. What I am interested in is the best practice in this area. for example, do we create a smart contract for a single asset, and just pass the owner around? or do we create a contract of paintings, assign a value, and pass the value around?",
